. 🪓 ! Before You Int . . . !!


I have trouble telling tones, and often will take most "off" statements as negative! I also am a people pleaser and need approval for everything I do!! I will not say if you break a boundary ( though I am getting help for it! ) If I upset you, PLEASE tell me gently so I don't think you just hate my guts ;-; , I have many disorders that affect how I talk and act! Please do not point these out unless needed, Those are the only times I will let others comment so I know I need to take a break as to not say things I don't mean and do things on impulse. Do not make sex jokes to me unless you are a close friend + do not mention abuse of any kind around me! I am also dyslexic and have a hard time speaking / texting! Do not make fun of my spelling unless close ;-; !!

. 🔪 ! Do not Interact if . . . !!

Basic DNI-- and i have no real dni! if you aren't a freak you can interact. if you are then... dont. please :)
